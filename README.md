Getting ready for your first harvest

Mayor Lewis' gift
Use the axe, pickaxe and sickle on the stumps, rocks, grasses and bushes on your farm to clear approximately 15 blocks.
Use your hoe to plow the soil and plant 15 parsnip seeds received by Mayor Lewis.
Use the watering can to water your seeds and soil.
Continue watering your crops every day until they are ready for harvest. Your parsnips will be ready to harvest in 4 days.

Watering can
Main page: Watering cans
Crops need to be watered daily so that they can grow. The starter watering can only water one block at a time and can be replenished using any water source within your farm.

Your crops can go a day without being watered. This means that you can water them every 2 days, but that means slower growth of the crop.

The best time to improve your watering can is the day before a rainy day, so the rain will water the crops and prevent them from running out of water. The penultimate day of the season is also a good date to improve it.

The blacksmith will need 2 days to upgrade any tool, including the watering can.

Another way to water your crops is through the use of sprinklers that need to be created and installed. Sprinklers will automatically water blocks around you every morning and do not need to be refilled. There are 3 types of sprinklers, starting with 4 blocks adjacent to the sprinkler, 8 blocks surrounding the sprinkler in a 3x3 area and finally 24 blocks around the sprinkler thus forming a 5x5 area.


Skills
Main page: Skills
To increase his skills, the player needs to perform certain actions related to that skill. Cultivation experience (XP) is gained by fully growing your crops. Gathering XP is gained by gathering items or cutting down trees. Mining XP is gained by breaking rocks and ore deposits. Fishing or using covo traps increases XP gained from fishing. As skill levels increase, the player will learn to craft new items (at all levels except levels 5 and 10) or choose professions (at levels 5 and 10).

Professions (levels 5 and 10) can give the player a boost when producing products, increase the income of the products as well as their varieties, using less inventory and other benefits.


Villagers and Friendship

As you gain friendship, villagers will send you cooking recipes or food in the mail, as well as allowing the player to access their rooms and have different dialogues. Unique scenes and new interactions can occur depending on the friendship level.

TV
